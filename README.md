# Will Archer Portfolio Website

## About The Project

Page URL: [https://mrwilliama.github.io/react-portfolio-app/](https://mrwilliama.github.io/react-portfolio-app/)

This is my final project for the AcademyXi FET02 Front End Web Development course. The project outlines are simple, create a website using React, Javascript HTML and CSS that demonstrates an understanding of front end website technologies (this is paraphrasing it a bit). I decided to make a React portfolio website showcasing some of the excerces and projects I worked on during this course, as well as a few bonus website and graphic projects from earlier.

## Built With

- React
- Javscript
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind
- JSON Server
- React Social Icons Library
- React Spring Animation Library
- getform

## Getting Started

**Install npm**

> `npm install`

**Install and run JSON Server**

> `npm install -g json-server`

> `npx json-server --watch src/components/portfolio/githubLinks.json --port 3004`

## Usage

The website requires json server to run properly so follow the steps above to gain access to the table data on te portfolio page. Other then that, its a basic portfolio website. Its purpose is to be explorerd by you, the user. Feel free to click around, if you find any propblems, or if you just want to talk, use the contact form to send me a message!

## Update

I have refactored some of the code so that JSON Server is no longer needed.
